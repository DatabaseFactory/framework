# How to contribute

Contributing to is rather easy:
 - Contributions are **only** accepted in the form of pull requests here on GitHub
 - All contributions **must** provide tests. PR's will not be accepted without 
   them.
 - All contributions **must** follow PSR-12 (or at least as close to it as is practical)
 
If the above is not met, a PR will be most likely glossed over and not accepted (on a case-by-case 
base of course).
